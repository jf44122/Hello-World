# Hello-World
Learning to use Github
I am in a coding boot camp where I spend about 40 hours a week learning to code and about 20 hours a week outside of class learning, practicing, and playing with HTML, CSS, Javascript, C#, and SQL. 
When I'm not coding, I enjoy various kinds of fitness, ranging from dance to yoga to climbing.
